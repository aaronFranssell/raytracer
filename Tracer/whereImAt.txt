K Cone limited hit logic is bad. The angle of hit point to base point is NOT alpha. Need to fix it...

Long term stuff...
Have an abstract Bounder class extend Surface that will return an interval, and then I will need to merge intervals together and such if they overlap.

Hmmm a THEORY about some BUGS I noticed...
	The reason I am thinking I'm getting odd results from CSG toruses is because I'm returning some Nans along with valid hits from the Torus.getHitData().
	Need to check into that more...
