I deleted everything, I want to start from scratch in how I think about hits to make it easier to do CSG...

Hmmm a THEORY about some BUGS I noticed...
	The reason I am thinking I'm getting odd results from CSG toruses is because I'm returning some Nans along with valid hits from the Torus.getHitData().
	Need to check into that more...
