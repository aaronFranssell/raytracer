Long term stuff...
Have an abstract Bounder class extend Surface that will return an interval, and then I will need to merge intervals together and such if they overlap.

Hmmm a THEORY about some BUGS I noticed...
	The reason I am thinking I'm getting odd results from CSG toruses is because I'm returning some Nans along with valid hits from the Torus.getHitData().
	Need to check into that more...
