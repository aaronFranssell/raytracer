Finishing up the refactoring for SceneRenderer... Now I need unit tests for everything, start with ResultsScalerImpl and work up the call hiearchy.

Long term stuff...
Need to use binary search for nth root functionality in factoring quartic... precision isn't that important...
Have an abstract Bounder class extend Surface that will return an interval, and then I will need to merge intervals together and such if they overlap.

Hmmm a THEORY about some BUGS I noticed...
	The reason I am thinking I'm getting odd results from CSG toruses is because I'm returning some Nans along with valid hits from the Torus.getHitData().
	Need to check into that more...
